A client CLI utility for [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) instances.

Much of the functionality requires Datasette 1.0a2 or higher.

## Things you can do with dclient

- Run SQL queries against Datasette and returning the results as JSON
- Run queries against authenticated Datasette instances
- Create aliases and store authentication tokens for convenient access to Datasette
- Insert data into Datasette using the [insert API](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/json_api.html#the-json-write-api) (Datasette 1.0 alpha or higher)

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:
```bash
pip install dclient
```
If you want to install it in the same virtual environment as Datasette (to use it as a plugin) you can instead run:
```bash
datasette install dclient
```
## Running a query

```bash
dclient query https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures "select * from facetable limit 1"
```
